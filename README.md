I always was interested in blogs, especially in sciences and technology so i decided to build myself a blogging app.
I used python language for the purpose.
According to task assigned i have used Flask micro web framework written in Python for the project.
Also i have used Jinja2 as the template engine nd for template inheritance from Base.html.
and i have used bootstrap also for template.
also for the database of the blogging app i have used Flask-SQLAlchemy for the database.
Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. 
It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.

To use the following app you have to clone the repository in the local directory.
then install flask by the following command in the command line
      - pip install flask 
      or
      
      -pip3 install flask
use 'sudo' before pip or pip3 if it asks for permission.
after that install flask-sql alchemy
      -sudo pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
      or
      -sudo pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy

then install pylint for bug and quality checker, also used to setup database (especially in visual studio code)
 
 then run the following command on your command line
 cd Flask-app-2021
 set FLASK_APP=app.py
 flask run
 
 then you will get your local host for your computer.
